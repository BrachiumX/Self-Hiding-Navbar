![hippo](https://media.giphy.com/media/MY55D71dPyF3hHFKob/giphy.gif)

The exact size and style of the navbar will change depending on the children it has.

### Install Motion

The animation uses the motion library.
```
npm install motion
```
### Usage 
To add buttons just add children to the Navbar just like any other html element.

```
<Navbar>
  <Button/>
  <Button/>
</Navbar>
```
The style may change depending on the children elements. <br><br>
**The buttons shown in the gif are not included but easy to implement with motion library.**
